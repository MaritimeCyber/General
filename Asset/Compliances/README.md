# Compliances — Cyber Compliance & Class Society Guidelines

## Background

The maritime industry operates under a layered regulatory environment in which flag states, port state control authorities, international organizations, and classification societies each impose cyber security obligations on vessels, shipyards, and port facilities. These requirements vary by country, vessel type, and operational context, making it essential to maintain an organized, up-to-date reference library.

This folder collects, organizes, and summarizes the key compliance documents, guidelines, and requirements that maritime stakeholders must navigate.

## Purpose

- Provide a centralized reference for cyber security regulations and guidelines across jurisdictions and organizations
- Map cross-standard requirements to support gap analysis and compliance planning
- Support the crew in developing templates, checklists, and tools grounded in actual regulatory text
