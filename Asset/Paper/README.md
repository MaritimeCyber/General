# Paper — Maritime Cyber Security Research Papers

## Background

Academic research and technical reports are foundational to building evidence-based cyber security practices in the maritime domain. This folder aggregates papers from international organizations (IMO, IACS), classification societies, academic journals, and government agencies that address cyber threats, risk assessment, and regulatory frameworks specific to ships, ports, and shipyards.

## Purpose

- Centralize key references for maritime cyber security research
- Enable quick access to standards-relevant literature for compliance work (IACS UR E26/E27, IMO MSC-FAL.1/Circ.3, etc.)
- Support the Maritime 4.0 Crew in producing well-referenced analysis and technical output

## Scope

| Source Type | Examples |
|---|---|
| **IMO / IACS** | Circulars, Unified Requirements, Recommendations |
| **Classification Societies** | DNV, LR, ClassNK, BV, ABS technical reports |
| **Academic Journals** | IEEE, MDPI, Springer — maritime and cyber security topics |
| **Government / Agency** | USCG, ENISA, BIMCO, Korean MOF reports |
| **Conference Proceedings** | ICSS, ICCWS, OCEANS, and related venues |

## Organization

Papers are organized by topic subfolder where volume justifies it:

```
