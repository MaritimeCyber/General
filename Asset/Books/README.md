# Books — Maritime Cyber Security Book Reviews

## Background

The maritime and shipbuilding industries are undergoing rapid digital transformation, yet the volume of dedicated cyber security literature specific to these sectors remains limited. This folder bridges that gap by collecting reviews and summaries of books that are directly or indirectly relevant to maritime cyber security — spanning OT/ICS security, risk management, regulatory compliance, and broader cyber security fundamentals.

## Purpose

- Provide concise reviews to help practitioners and researchers select the most relevant reading material
- Summarize key concepts and map them to maritime-specific contexts (e.g., IACS UR E26/E27, IMO guidelines)
- Build a shared reading list for the Maritime 4.0 Crew and the wider community

## Scope

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Cyber Security Fundamentals** | General frameworks (NIST CSF, IEC 62443), threat modeling |
| **OT / ICS Security** | Industrial control systems, SCADA, ship automation |
| **Maritime & Shipbuilding** | Smart ship, smart yard, digital twin |
| **Risk & Compliance** | Cyber risk management, regulatory compliance methodology |
