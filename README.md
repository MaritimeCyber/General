## Purpose

The modern maritime industry faces cyber security requirements from a wide range of international regulatory bodies including IMO, IACS, and Flag States.
This repository is operated with the following goals:

- Research on cyber security compliance technologies for shipbuilding, maritime, and port sectors (IACS UR E26/E27, IMO MSC-FAL.1/Circ.3, etc.)
- Open-source publication of tools, templates, and guidelines applicable in practice
- Knowledge sharing through book reviews and curated research papers
- Community-driven development open to researchers, practitioners, and students
